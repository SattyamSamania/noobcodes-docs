# Maximal Square

### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` binary matrix filled with `0's` and `1's`, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)

#### Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max1grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]

Output: 4
```

#### Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]

Output: 1
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]

Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` is '`0`' or '`1`'.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution:
    def maximalSquare(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if matrix is None or len(matrix) < 1:
            return 0

        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])

        dp = [[0]*(cols+1) for _ in range(rows+1)]
        max_side = 0

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == '1':
                    dp[r+1][c+1] = min(dp[r][c], dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1]) + 1 # Be careful of the indexing since dp grid has additional row and column
                    max_side = max(max_side, dp[r+1][c+1])

        return max_side * max_side

```
